# Color-Switch
Implemented a replica of the famous game color switch 

## Description of the game 

The purpose of this game is to tap a ball so it can move upward (initially it would be of a particular colour) through obstacles of different colours (these obstacles will be circles whose center is empty but borders are of different colours).The speed of the ball will be constant with each key press.If the user stops pressing a key, the ball will fall down with gravity.The ball can only go through colours that are the same of its own.Throughout the game, the ball’s colour will change when the ball passes through a power-up (it would be bound to).If it collides with a different color, the game will end.The display method draws the circle twice (for graphic reasons)The outer collide method takes two arguments, the ball object and a boolen (this is to determine if the collision has occured with the color wheel or the arcs.
